This section stores some extra tools.

- **am2plasite**, a script to update main pages of our catalog at [portable-linux-apps.github.io](#https://portable-linux-apps.github.io) using the application's list from this repo
- **ghcr_dl.sh**, a script that allows ghcr logs to be parsed for binary downloads using `wget` and `curl` instead of `oras`

Other scripts or binaries can be added as appropriate.
